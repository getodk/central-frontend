Use setInstallLocation() when you want to trigger a navigation, then mount a
component before the navigation is confirmed. (This is the sequence that happens
in production.) At least how Vue Router works right now, when a router is
installed on an app instance, it will trigger a navigation unless the initial
navigation has already been completed:
https://github.com/vuejs/router/blob/df836529db63360f0bf9810ccd4e8911846aef45/packages/router/src/router.ts#L1211-L1223
There doesn't seem to be an easy way to get the router to skip that navigation.
However, setInstallLocation() can be used to set the location that the router
will navigate to.

/* mockRouter() returns a function to create a router-like object that cannot
navigate and never calls navigation hooks. In a sense, the object is like a
read-only router: the object's current route will never change once the object
is initialized. If installed on an app instance, the object will register stubs
for <router-link> and <router-view>. If you need a router that can navigate, use
testRouter(). */
